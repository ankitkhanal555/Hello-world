# Hello-world

Straight outta Kathmandu
But I hip to the hop like a black man do
Third world kid with an internet access
And a funky ass song you can tap dance to
We living it hard everyday
F a government job
'Cause it don't really pay
Hey! I'd rather stay broke for real
We even got a Hindu God who smokes and chills
I'm the man when I do this
Everybody clueless when I'm dropping a rhyme
Need a broad from abroad who's a fan of my music
And she better drop it lower than the poverty line
Who can do it better than that?
I'm what you make when you go and paint Eminem black
Uh, gimme the mic, and I'm ready to rap
Put my nation on the map with a pen and a pad, go
Doesn't really matter where you're from
'Cause the funky drums are gonna turn you on
Lemme tell you 'bout the thing I'm on
Hip-Hop don't stop 'til the break of dawn
So do what you want, forget about the rules
Don't worry 'bout nada 'cause there's nothing to lose
Doesn't really matter where you're from
'Cause the funky drums are gonna turn you on
